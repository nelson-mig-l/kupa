# KUPA

## What?

A shitty https://poople.io/ solver.

## Why?

 * Because I wanted to.
 * Looked like a funny little project to experiment with https://pyscript.net.
 * Why not?

## How?

1. List of words was retrieved from the poople website.
2. A graph of words is build connecting words that differ by one letter.
3. Shortest path between start word and poop is the best solution.
